# Stage 3: Nand2Tetris

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand the full stack: hardware → OS
- Build a computer and software stack from scratch
- Strengthen intuition about compilers and operating systems

## 📚 Resources
- *The Elements of Computing Systems* by Noam Nisan & Shimon Schocken
- Nand2Tetris official course (Coursera / book)

## 📝 Projects
- Logic Gates
- ALU
- CPU
- Assembler
- Virtual Machine
- Jack Compiler
- Mini Operating System

## ✅ Outcomes
By the end of Nand2Tetris, you will have built a computer system and its software stack, gaining intuition for later compiler, OS, and database projects.
