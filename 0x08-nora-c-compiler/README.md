# Stage 8: Nora’s C Compiler

## 🎯 Goals
- Deepen compiler knowledge by building a real C compiler
- Explore code generation and stack frames
- Strengthen low-level programming skills

## 📚 Resources
- Nora Sandler’s “Writing a C Compiler”
- *Modern Compiler Implementation in C* by Andrew Appel
- GCC/Clang (for reference)

## 📝 Projects
- Lexer & Parser
- AST & Code Generation
- Stack Frames
- Final C Compiler

## ✅ Outcomes
You will have implemented a small C compiler, reinforcing your knowledge of parsing, code generation, and low-level execution.
